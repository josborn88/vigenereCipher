# vigenereCipher
Just a simple Python script to encrypt and decrypt a message using the vigenere cipher, made in Python.

# To Use

To use: 
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your message while ommiting punctuation marks. You can leave spaces in, the script will remove them for you.
3. Enter your key. Your key can be as long or short as you desire. Longer keys are more secure, but harder to remember.
4. Select mode of operation. Enter encrypt(or e) to encrypt a message using your key. Or select decrypt(or d) to decrypt a message you recive using your key.
5. Repeact this process as often as needed.

And that is it, a simple, easy to use program to impliment the vigenere cipher using python.
